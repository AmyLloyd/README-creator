# README-creator

## Description
The inspiration for this project was the experience of completing a large project and then needing to complete a README file at the end with limited time and limited energy left over. 

Creating this README creator has allowed me to learn how to use the inquirer package to prompt for responses through the commandline. This will be a very helpful tool in the development of apps in the future.
